My app is a short dungeon crawler game inspired by games like Slay the Spire and other dungeon rouge-likes.
There will be six characters to choose from, each with their own set of abilities. You will start out on the first floor,
then you will choose if you want to take one of three paths, easy, medium, or hard. You’ll keep climbing the floors,
fighting various monsters, until you reach the final floor where the end boss awaits. If you lose and are defeated along your way to the final boss,
you will have to restart back at the first floor and climb your way back up the floors.

Characters will gain experience points by defeating enemies on various floors which will allow them to level up and unlock new abilities. 
Leveling up will also increase the character’s base stats, such as HP, DEF, and DMG points. Character levels and stats will stay with 
said characters upon losing and winning, so each play-through you’ll be able to make it to higher floors and get back to where you left off easier.

I’ll be using Java, Spring Boot, SQL DB, and an Angular front end app to complete this project.
